# Data Flow Diagram â€“ Airbnb Clone Backend

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This directory contains the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for the backend architecture of the Airbnb Clone project. The DFD provides a high-level visualization of how data flows through the system across different modules and user interactions.

## ðŸ§© Key Components

The DFD captures the following core entities and their interactions:

- **Users** (Guests, Hosts, Admins)
- **Processes** such as:
  - User registration and authentication
  - Property listing and updates
  - Booking requests and confirmations
  - Payment processing
  - Review and rating submissions
  - Admin moderation
- **Data Stores**:
  - User database
  - Property listings
  - Booking records
  - Payment transactions
  - Review storage
- **External Services**:
  - Payment Gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)
  - Email Services (e.g., SendGrid)

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

The DFD provides a clear understanding of how data moves within the system, helping developers and stakeholders:

- Identify the input/output boundaries of each process
- Understand the interaction between users and backend services
- Visualize dependencies and optimize backend performance

## ðŸ“¤ How to Use

Open the `data-flow.png` file to view the visual representation of the backend logic and flow. This serves as a blueprint for developers during the implementation of backend features.
